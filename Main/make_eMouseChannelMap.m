function make_eMouseChannelMap(fpath)
% create a channel Map file for simulated data (eMouse)

% here I know a priori what order my channels are in.  So I just manually 
% make a list of channel indices (and give
% an index to dead channels too). chanMap(1) is the row in the raw binary
% file for the first channel. chanMap(1:2) = [33 34] in my case, which happen to
% be dead channels. 

chanMap = [31 30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 ...
    16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1];

% the first thing Kilosort does is reorder the data with data = data(chanMap, :).
% Now we declare which channels are "connected" in this normal ordering, 
% meaning not dead or used for non-ephys data

connected = true(31, 1); 
% connected(1:3) = 0; For no connections

% now we define the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) coordinates of these
% channels. For dead or nonephys channels the values won't matter. Again
% I will take this information from the specifications of the probe. These
% are in um here, but the absolute scaling doesn't really matter in the
% algorithm. 

xcoords = ones(1,31);
ycoords = 1:31; 

% Often, multi-shank probes or tetrodes will be organized into groups of
% channels that cannot possibly share spikes with the rest of the probe. This helps
% the algorithm discard noisy templates shared across groups. In
% this case, we set kcoords to indicate which group the channel belongs to.
% In our case all channels are on the same shank in a single group so we
% assign them all to group 1. 

kcoords = [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1];

% at this point in Kilosort we do data = data(connected, :), ycoords =
% ycoords(connected), xcoords = xcoords(connected) and kcoords =
% kcoords(connected) and no more channel map information is needed (in particular
% no "adjacency graphs" like in KlustaKwik). 
% Now we can save our channel map for the eMouse. 

% would be good to also save the sampling frequency here
