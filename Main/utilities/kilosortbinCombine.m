function fpath = kilosortbinCombine()
%% Function to combine kilsort bin files for multiple session spike sorting.
%Caution: Check Issue #132 on Mouseland kilosort for potential
%complications with this approach. TLDR: The correlation matrix during the
%spike sorting can generate a very large matrix if the drift correction
%fails. Causing memory bottlenecking on the GPU.
